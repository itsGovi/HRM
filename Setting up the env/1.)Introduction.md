# **Introduction**

## Installing Required Software and Libraries

1. **Setting Up Python**  
   Before diving into the database setup, ensure you’re using Python 3.11 or later, as it supports the latest security and performance features beneficial for database projects. [Download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and remember to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation. This will save you an extra configuration step.

   If you've already installed Python but didn't add it to your PATH, follow these steps:
   - **Windows**: Go to "Edit the system environment variables," select "Environment Variables," and find the PATH variable under "System variables." Click "Edit" and add the path to your Python installation (e.g., `C:\Python311`).
   - **Mac/Linux**: Open your terminal and type:

     ```bash
            
            echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin/python3:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
            source ~/.bash_profile
     
     ```
   
2. **Installing Required Libraries**  
   Make sure you’re inside a virtual environment for this project to keep dependencies organized. Run:

   ```bash
    
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
    .\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   
   ```

   Then install `psycopg2`, `dotenv`, and other necessary libraries:

   ```bash
        pip install psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Connecting VS Code to PostgreSQL**  
   A powerful way to interact with your database is through VS Code. For a clear walkthrough on how to connect VS Code to PostgreSQL, check out this straightforward [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzdCpJY6Y4c&ab_channel=BoostMyTool).

4. **Organizing Files and Scripts**  
   Your project will include multiple files, each dedicated to a specific task in the data pipeline. Key scripts to look out for:
   - `import_hr_data.py` – loads the initial data into PostgreSQL.
   - `db_setup_diagnostics.py` – verifies database integrity.
   - `database.py` – integrates SQLAlchemy for advanced interactions with PostgreSQL.

2. Install PostgreSQL
Database Setup: PostgreSQL will serve as the backbone of our database system. If you’re new to data analytics or data science, I recommend this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/85pG_pDkITY?si=V0DzvXep8gzjum-j). It covers about 90% of practical SQL usage and introduces some advanced topics, which could be helpful for future projects.

3. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Code Editor: VS Code is a versatile editor that can be set up specifically for data analysis and database management. Numerous online tutorials guide you through setting it up for Data Analysis/Data Science (DA/DS) work. This includes installing all necessary libraries, though I’ll provide a list of essential ones below.

4. Essential Python Libraries
Here are the primary libraries you'll need to get started. Adjust versions according to compatibility with Python 3.11 or slightly lower versions if necessary:

    ```
        pandas==2.0.3
        sqlalchemy==2.0.20
        psycopg2-binary==2.9.7
        python-dotenv==1.0.0
        numpy==1.24.3
        matplotlib==3.7.2
        seaborn==0.12.2
        jupyter==1.0.0
    ```

Note: Always check compatibility with Python 3.11 and aim to use the latest stable versions within that range for optimal performance.

6. Create a "Progress_Journal" Folder
Purpose: Track your learning process and mistakes in this folder. This log will help you avoid repeating errors. After all, **_“One should make original mistakes. Original mistakes might make you look foolish, but making the same mistake more than once is just plain dumb!”_ — Govardhan Yadav (me).**
