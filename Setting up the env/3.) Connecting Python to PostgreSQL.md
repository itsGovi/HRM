# This SQLAlchemy will reply on properly initailzed data, so `2.) Importing data...` is important

### 1. **Using the `.env` File for Storing Database Credentials**

- You've already got your `.env` file set up with basic credentials:

     ```
        plaintext
        DB_NAME=hr_resource_db
        DB_USER=postgres
        DB_PASSWORD=1234
     ```

    - This file allows us to securely load environment variables in Python without hard-coding sensitive information like the database username and password directly into the code.

### 2. **Understanding and Using SQLAlchemy**

- **What is SQLAlchemy?**
  - SQLAlchemy is a library that acts as an *Object-Relational Mapper* (ORM), allowing Python code to interact with a relational database in a more Pythonic way. Instead of writing raw SQL queries, SQLAlchemy lets us use Python objects and methods to interact with the database.
  - It’s useful because it makes database interactions easier to manage, reduces SQL syntax errors, and can make the code more modular.

- **Why Use SQLAlchemy?**
  - In this project, SQLAlchemy will allow us to connect Python to PostgreSQL more easily, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and scale the project if you decide to add more complex interactions with the database in the future.

- **Implementing SQLAlchemy Without Disturbing Your Current Setup**
  - We’ll start by setting up a simple database connection using SQLAlchemy. This won’t disrupt anything you’ve already set up and will integrate smoothly with your current codebase.

### 3. **Next Step: Connecting Python to PostgreSQL Using SQLAlchemy**

Let’s walk through the code for setting up a connection and performing basic CRUD operations. Make sure the following libraries are installed (you can install them by running `pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-dotenv` if not):

1. **Creating a `database.py` File**  
   Create a file called `database.py` in your project to handle the database connection.

   ```python
   # database.py
   import os
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   from dotenv import load_dotenv

   # Load environment variables from .env file
   load_dotenv()

   # Retrieve database connection info from environment variables
   DB_NAME = os.getenv("DB_NAME")
   DB_USER = os.getenv("DB_USER")
   DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
   DB_HOST = "localhost"  # Typically, the host is 'localhost' for local installations
   DB_PORT = "5432"       # Default PostgreSQL port

   # Construct the database URL
   DATABASE_URL = f"postgresql://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}"

   # Create a database engine
   engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

   # Test the connection
   def test_connection():
       try:
           with engine.connect() as connection:
               print("Connection to PostgreSQL successful!")
       except Exception as e:
           print("Connection failed:", e)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       test_connection()
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - This script connects to PostgreSQL using `SQLAlchemy`.
     - `load_dotenv()` loads the credentials from the `.env` file.
     - We then create a connection string (`DATABASE_URL`) that SQLAlchemy will use.
     - The `test_connection` function attempts to connect to the database and outputs a message based on the result.

2. **Running the Connection Test**
   - Run `database.py` to check if the connection is successful:

    ```
        bash
        python database.py
    ```

    - You should see `Connection to PostgreSQL successful!` if everything is set up correctly.

### 4. **Basic CRUD Operations to Test the Setup**

Now, let’s add basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a separate file. Create a new file called `crud_operations.py` to make this easier to test.

```python

# crud_operations.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

DB_NAME = os.getenv("DB_NAME")
DB_USER = os.getenv("DB_USER")
DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_PORT = "5432"

DATABASE_URL = f"postgresql://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

# CREATE operation - Add a new department
def create_department(name):
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        connection.execute(text("INSERT INTO departments (name) VALUES (:name)"), {"name": name})
        print(f"Department '{name}' created.")

# READ operation - Get all departments
def read_departments():
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT * FROM departments"))
        departments = result.fetchall()
        for department in departments:
            print(department)

# UPDATE operation - Update a department name
def update_department(old_name, new_name):
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        connection.execute(text("UPDATE departments SET name = :new_name WHERE name = :old_name"), {"new_name": new_name, "old_name": old_name})
        print(f"Department '{old_name}' updated to '{new_name}'.")

# DELETE operation - Delete a department
def delete_department(name):
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        connection.execute(text("DELETE FROM departments WHERE name = :name"), {"name": name})
        print(f"Department '{name}' deleted.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test each CRUD operation
    create_department("Engineering")
    read_departments()
    update_department("Engineering", "Research & Development")
    read_departments()
    delete_department("Research & Development")
    read_departments()

```

- **Explanation of CRUD Operations**:
  - **CREATE**: Adds a new record to the `departments` table.
  - **READ**: Fetches all records from the `departments` table and displays them.
  - **UPDATE**: Changes the name of an existing department.
  - **DELETE**: Removes a department by name.

- **Note**: Make sure that the `departments` table exists in your PostgreSQL database. Here’s an example of how to create it:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE departments (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

### 5. **Testing CRUD Operations**

1. Run `crud_operations.py`:

    ```

    bash
    python crud_operations.py

    ```

2. You should see output corresponding to each CRUD operation. For example:

    ```

    Department 'Engineering' created.
    (1, 'Engineering')
    Department 'Engineering' updated to 'Research & Development'.
    (1, 'Research & Development')
    Department 'Research & Development' deleted.

    ```
