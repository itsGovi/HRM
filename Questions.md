# 6 Questions for R-DBMS

Here are five focused questions along with one overarching question for a comprehensive visualization that aligns all insights toward a broader goal:

1. **What factors most influence employee retention across different departments?**

   - Analyze relationships between performance ratings, work satisfaction, training hours, team size, and retention rates. This could help in identifying areas where improved support or training might increase retention.
2. **Which performance metrics (e.g., project completion rate, productivity, engagement) correlate most strongly with high client satisfaction in sales and customer-facing roles?**

   - This question targets factors in performance that align with customer satisfaction, which can be critical in customer-facing departments like Sales and IT.
3. **How does remote work status affect productivity and engagement scores across different roles and departments?**

   - Investigate whether employees working remotely or in hybrid settings have comparable productivity and engagement levels, which could inform flexible work policies and their effects on team dynamics.
4. **What is the impact of training hours, certifications, and mentoring on employee performance across various metrics?**

   - Examine how development-focused activities (e.g., training, certifications, mentoring) contribute to performance improvements, retention, and overall satisfaction, providing insights into the ROI of professional development programs.
5. **What are the key drivers of recruitment success in terms of time-to-fill, retention rate, and recruitment source?**

   - This question seeks to uncover patterns and best practices in recruitment, enabling HR to optimize hiring strategies that lead to long-term employee retention and reduce time-to-hire costs.

### **BIG PICTURE QUESTION:**

6. **How can we design an optimal employee experience strategy that aligns retention, productivity, and client satisfaction with professional development and recruitment policies?**
   - This comprehensive question can bring together the insights from all the individual questions. The goal is to create a visualization that highlights how these factors interplay to build a more effective employee experience strategy, ensuring that recruitment, training, performance, and satisfaction align towards a more productive, satisfied, and loyal workforce.

Each of these questions can be visualized using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to generate insightful dashboards and comprehensive visuals.
