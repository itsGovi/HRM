Here are five high-ROI questions that progressively build toward a "big picture" visualization, connecting various aspects of the HR data to provide a comprehensive overview:

1. **What is the turnover rate per department and position over the last five years?**
   - *Goal*: Identify departments and roles with the highest turnover, which can reveal organizational challenges, team morale, or position-specific issues. 
   
2. **How does employee engagement correlate with performance scores across departments?**
   - *Goal*: Explore how engagement levels align with performance outcomes, highlighting potential areas for improvement in employee satisfaction to boost performance.

3. **What is the trend in hiring sources that yield the highest employee retention and performance?**
   - *Goal*: Analyze recruitment sources (LinkedIn, Indeed, referrals) to determine which yield the most productive, long-term employees, informing hiring strategies for quality hires.

4. **How does the salary distribution vary across departments and positions, and what is its impact on retention and satisfaction?**
   - *Goal*: Investigate pay discrepancies by department and position to assess their potential influence on employee satisfaction and retention, guiding equitable compensation strategies.

5. **What are the most common reasons for termination by department, and how do these reasons relate to engagement and performance scores?**
   - *Goal*: Understand the main factors driving employee exit decisions in different areas, offering insights into how to preemptively address these issues to reduce attrition.

6. **Ultimate Question: What strategic actions can be taken to optimize workforce satisfaction, retention, and performance across the organization?**
   - *Goal*: Synthesize insights from the questions above into a comprehensive view, enabling a roadmap for improved retention, satisfaction, and performance aligned with the organization’s needs.

This “big picture” analysis would reveal patterns and guide strategic actions across recruitment, compensation, and departmental development, offering a cohesive approach to enhance organizational health.
