   - Insights here can reveal departments with underutilized or highly productive employees, helping to optimize resource allocation.
2. **Retention Risk and Flight Risk Drivers**

   - What factors (e.g., compensation, utilization, project complexity) correlate with high flight and retention risks?
   - Identifying these can help prioritize employee retention initiatives, especially in high-turnover roles or departments.
3. **Promotion Readiness and Skill Gaps**

   - Analyzing this can guide employee development programs and enhance project outcomes.
6. **Integrated Workforce Optimization Strategy**

   - How can we integrate insights from employee utilization, retention risks, promotion readiness, engagement, and specializations to develop a workforce optimization strategy?
