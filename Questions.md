# 6 Questions for R-DBMS



Here are five key analytical questions, followed by a sixth question that ties them together for a comprehensive overview:

1. **Performance and Compensation Alignment**

   - How do employee performance scores correlate with their total compensation within different departments and job levels?
   - This analysis could reveal if compensation strategies are effectively incentivizing high performance.
2. **Impact of Remote Work on Productivity and Engagement**

   - What patterns exist between remote work ratios, productivity (utilization rate), and engagement scores across different regions and roles?
   - This can help refine remote work policies, ensuring productivity is maintained without impacting engagement.
3. **Flight Risk Factors and Retention Strategies**

   - What are the primary factors associated with high flight and retention risks by department? How do these align with factors like billing rate and active projects?
   - Addressing this could improve retention by focusing on areas with high turnover risk.
4. **Skills and Project Outcomes**

   - How do specific skills and certifications correlate with project outcomes (on-time completion and satisfaction ratings)?
   - This will help target training or hiring strategies to ensure key skills are aligned with successful project execution.
5. **Promotion Readiness and Knowledge Sharing**

   - Are employees who score high in promotion readiness also contributing significantly to knowledge-sharing metrics (training and mentorship hours)?
   - This can identify potential leaders who not only excel in performance but also enhance team capabilities.
6. **Comprehensive Workforce Strategy**

   - How can we integrate findings from performance alignment, remote productivity, flight risk, skill impact, and promotion readiness to formulate a comprehensive workforce optimization strategy?
   - This final analysis can connect the dots between these metrics, guiding a balanced approach to employee development, retention, and overall productivity for maximum ROI.

These questions would allow for a thorough exploration of the dataset, producing valuable insights for strategic decision-making across the company.
