# Connecting Python to PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy

In this section, we’ll set up a secure connection between Python and PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy and configure basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This guide is designed for beginners, so all steps are explained in detail.

## 1. Using the `.env` File to Store Database Credentials

To keep your PostgreSQL credentials secure, store them in an environment file (`.env`). This keeps sensitive information like database passwords out of your main script.

1. **Create or Update the `.env` File**:

    ```plaintext
            DB_NAME=hr_resource_db
            DB_USER=postgres
            DB_PASSWORD=1234
    ```

    This `.env` file will allow us to load these variables securely in Python.

2. **Loading Environment Variables**:
    Install `python-dotenv` if you haven’t already:

    ```bash
            pip install python-dotenv
    ```

3. In your Python script, we will use `load_dotenv()` to access these environment variables.

## 2. Understanding and Using SQLAlchemy

### What is SQLAlchemy?

SQLAlchemy is a library that acts as an **Object-Relational Mapper** (ORM), allowing Python code to interact with a relational database in a more Pythonic way. Instead of writing raw SQL queries, SQLAlchemy enables us to use Python objects and methods to interact with the database.

### Why Use SQLAlchemy?

SQLAlchemy simplifies database interactions by reducing SQL syntax errors and making the code modular. It enables smoother integration with PostgreSQL for CRUD operations and scales easily for more complex operations.

## 3. Setting Up SQLAlchemy to Connect with PostgreSQL

1. **Install SQLAlchemy** (and `psycopg2` to enable PostgreSQL connections):

    ```bash
            pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
    ```

2. **Creating a `database.py` File for Database Connection**:
    This file will establish a connection to PostgreSQL using the credentials from the `.env` file:

    ```py
            # database.py
            import os
            from sqlalchemy import create_engine
            from dotenv import load_dotenv

            # Load environment variables
            load_dotenv()

            # Retrieve database connection info
            DB_NAME = os.getenv("DB_NAME")
            DB_USER = os.getenv("DB_USER")
            DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
            DB_HOST = "localhost"
            DB_PORT = "5432"

            DATABASE_URL = f"postgresql://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}"
            engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

            # Test the connection
            def test_connection():
                try:
                    with engine.connect() as connection:
                        print("Connection to PostgreSQL successful!")
                except Exception as e:
                    print("Connection failed:", e)

            if __name__ == "__main__":
                test_connection()
    ```

    This script securely connects Python to PostgreSQL and tests the connection.

## 4. Setting Up SQLAlchemy Models for Database Tables

To perform CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy, define your database tables as Python classes called **models**. This step maps Python classes to tables, letting SQLAlchemy handle the SQL details.

1. **Defining Models**:
    In `database.py`, add classes that represent your tables (for example, an `Employee` table):

    ```py
            from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
            from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

            Base = declarative_base()

            class Employee(Base):
                __tablename__ = 'employees'
                id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
                name = Column(String)
                position = Column(String)
    ```

2. **Creating or Updating Tables**:
    After defining models, ensure the tables exist in your PostgreSQL database by running:

    ```py
            from sqlalchemy import create_engine
            engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

            Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    ```

## 5. Configuring CRUD Operations with SQLAlchemy

With the connection and models set, we can perform CRUD operations directly on the database.

### Create (Adding Data)

```py
        from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

        Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
        session = Session()

        new_employee = Employee(name="John Doe", position="Data Analyst")
        session.add(new_employee)
        session.commit()
```

### Read (Retrieving Data)

```py
        employees = session.query(Employee).all()
        for employee in employees:
            print(f"{employee.id}: {employee.name} - {employee.position}")
```

### Update (Modifying Data)

```py
employee_to_update = session.query(Employee).filter_by(name="John Doe").first()
employee_to_update.position = "Senior Data Analyst"
session.commit()
```

### Delete (Removing Data)

```py
        employee_to_delete = session.query(Employee).filter_by(name="John Doe").first()
        session.delete(employee_to_delete)
        session.commit()
```

## Why CRUD Operations Are Important

These CRUD operations are the basic building blocks of any application that interacts with a database. Mastering them will allow you to manipulate data dynamically and bring your project to life, giving you the power to add, view, modify, and remove data as needed.

This combined guide provides a seamless transition from environment configuration to database connection and finally, CRUD operations, giving you full control over PostgreSQL from your Python script in a beginner-friendly way.
